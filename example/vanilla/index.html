      <h1>Introducing the CSS Cascade</h1>
      <p>
        The cascade is an algorithm that defines how user agents combine property values originating from different sources.
        The cascade defines the origin and layer that takes precedence when declarations in more than one origin or cascade layer set a value for a property on an element.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cascade lies at the core of CSS, as emphasized by the name: Cascading Style Sheets.
        When a selector matches an element, the property value from the origin with the highest precedence gets applied,
        even if the selector from a lower precedence origin or layer has greater specificity.
      </p>
      <p>
        This article explains what the cascade is and the order in which CSS declarations cascade,
        covering cascade layers and origin type.
        Understanding origin precedence is key to understanding the cascade.
      </p>
      <h2>Origin types</h2>
      <p>The CSS cascade algorithm's job is to select CSS declarations in order to determine the correct values for CSS properties.
        CSS declarations come from different origin types: User-agent stylesheets, Author stylesheets, and User stylesheets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though style sheets come from these different origins and can be within different layers in each of these origins,
        they overlap in scope; to make this work, the cascade algorithm defines how they interact. Before addressing the interactions,
        let's define some terms:
      </p>
      <h2>User-agent stylesheets</h2>
      <p>
        User-agent, or browsers, have basic style sheets that give default styles to any document.
        These style sheets are named user-agent stylesheets. Most browsers use actual stylesheets for this purpose,
        while others simulate them in code. The end result is the same.
      </p>
      <p>Some browsers let users modify the user-agent stylesheet, but this is rare and not something that can be controlled.</p>
      <p>
        Although some constraints on user-agent stylesheets are set by the HTML specification,
        browsers have a lot of latitude: that means some differences exist between browsers.
        To simplify the development process, Web developers may use a CSS reset stylesheet,
        such as normalize.css,
        which sets common properties values to a known state for all browsers before beginning to make alterations to suit their specific needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless the user-agent stylesheet includes an !important next to a property,
        making it "important", styles declared by author styles, including a reset style sheet,
        take precedence over the user-agent styles, regardless of the specificity of the associated selector.
      </p>
      <h2>Author stylesheets</h2>
      <p>
        Author stylesheets are the most common type of style sheet; these are the styles written by web developers.
        These styles can reset user-agent styles, as noted above,
        and define the styles for the design of a given web page or application.
        The author, or web developer, defines the styles for the document using one or more linked or imported stylesheets,
        style blocks, and inline styles defined with the style attribute.
        These author styles define the look and feel of the website â€” its theme.
